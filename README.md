# MindTheMinutes

A web application that will facilitate the organization in keeping meeting notes (minutes), during internal or external meetings with clients. 
Organization users can register into the platform and can create and schedule an upcoming meeting.
When the meeting (or call) takes place, the creator of the meeting can login and start the meeting. 
After starting the meeting the creator can take meeting notes and for each item keep a description, a due date (if it is an actionable item), 
a risk level (risk levels should be configurable on administration), note who requested this item and optionally assign the item to a person. 
When the meeting ends, a mail template is constructed and sent to all meeting participants, except for the items that are not marked as Visible.
